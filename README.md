# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

In this repository, I uploaded the projects that I did in order to get practical understanding of Machine Learning algorithms.
I only appllied small data preprocessing techniques to make the data ready for training, however our main focus while doing these 
projects is learning and understanding the algorithms by applying them in real world problems. Therefore, in some algorithms, the accuracy of the 
results may not be sufficient, but here in this repository we are just learning. In the future projects, I will apply feature engineering
techniques in order to increase the accuracy and also some advanced algorithms.

This repository consists of the following folders:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes Theorem
4. KNN
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. K-Means Clustering
8. Support Vector Machines
9. Boosting algorithms

In each folder, there are these files: 
- the code of the project
- the dataset that is used in the project
- the code of the "building algorithm from scratch without using built-in techniques
- The pdf of the used algorithm which simply explains the algorithm

I firstly applied algorithm by using sklearn library, then I wrote the code to build the algorithm from scracth without using sklearn library.
I believe coding the algorithm from scratch will help a lot to fully understand the algorithm.
